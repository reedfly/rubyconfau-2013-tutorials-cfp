# Rails for iOS Developers

You've got your iPhone app almost ready to go, but now you need a website. You're an iOS developer, not a web developer, and every day that goes by is another day that your app ISN'T in the App Store. You can outsource your server-side development, but that costs both time & money. What if you could build your own website? Our Rails for iOS Developers Tutorial will help you get your responsive website up and running, using the powerful Ruby on Rails framework, from creation to deployment, in straight-forward, easy to follow steps.
